### 📊 Overview
This project analyzes Formula 1 data from 1950–2025 to quantify how dominant each team has been in every season.  
Using performance metrics such as win rate, podium share, qualifying strength, and 1–2 finishes, a **Team Dominance Index (TDI)** is computed to visualize shifts in team supremacy across eras.
